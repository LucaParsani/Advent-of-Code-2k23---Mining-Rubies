# Advent-of-Code-2k23---Mining-Rubies

This year I decided to try solving the Advent of Code using only Ruby, let's see how it goes lol <br>
The algorithms are not going to be optimized <br>

- Day 1:
  - The string manipulation using regular expressions is waaaaaaay efficient. Almost made this too easy, looking forward to unravel other Ruby wonders
- Day 2:
  - It's kinda weird that the best practice for methods is not ```return variable``` but just ```variable```, yet i'll live with that. Also i lost a loooot of time because i forgot comparisons with regular expressions are made with ```=~``` and not ```==```. Still, i am really enjoying this language
- Day 3:
  - The ```.each_with_index``` method for iteration made the difference, really sweet. Overall, a lot of code in this exercise but it wasn't too difficult, somehow i lost very little time debugging
